        <p></p>

        <p>
            I offer consulting services for those needing expert input on issues relating to spacecraft
            propulsion, especially electric propulsion, scientific computing, and 
            low temperature plasma physics. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to scientific consulting, I also provide professional map-making,
            illustration, and graphic design services. You can view some examples of my work <a href="portfolio">here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            My current base rate is around $250 / hour, billed on the half hour
            with a minimum of one half hour. 
            These rates are flexible depending on the type of work and ability to pay.
            Please contact me at <a href="thomasarchermarks@gmail.com">this email</a>
            if you are interested and we can work something out!
