	         models for anomalous electron transport in fluid simulations of Hall
	         thrusters},
	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The performance of closure models for the anomalous electron
	            transport when self-consistently implemented in a fluid model for
	            a Hall effect thruster is investigated. This cross-field
	            transport, which is orders of magnitude higher than classical
	            collisional transport, is represented as an effective collision
	            frequency. The proposed closure models relate this transport
	            coefficient to local fluid properties of the plasma. Before
	            implementation, the models are calibrated against values of the
	            collision frequency inferred empirically from a 9 kW Hall
	            thruster at 300 V and 15 A. It is found that even though closure
	            models match the empirical collision frequency values, they
	            diverge from these values when implemented self-consistently in a
	            Hall thruster code. Possible drivers of this behavior are
	            examined, including the role of non-linearity in the governing
	            equations of the Hall thruster fluid model, artifacts from using
	            time-averaged calibration data, and the non-uniqueness of the
	            empirically-inferred collision frequencies. These results are
	            discussed in the context of their implications for discovering
	            and validating new closures necessary for enabling
	            fully-predictive Hall thruster models.},
