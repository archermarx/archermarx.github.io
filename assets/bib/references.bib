    abstract = {The performance of closure models for the anomalous electron transport when self-consistently implemented in a fluid model for a Hall effect thruster is investigated. This cross-field transport, which is orders of magnitude higher than classical collisional transport, is represented as an effective collision frequency. The proposed closure models relate this transport coefficient to local fluid properties of the plasma. Before implementation, the models are calibrated against values of the collision frequency inferred empirically from a 9 kW Hall thruster at 300 V and 15 A. It is found that even though closure models match the empirical collision frequency values, they diverge from these values when implemented self-consistently in a Hall thruster code. Possible drivers of this behavior are examined, including the role of non-linearity in the governing equations of the Hall thruster fluid model, artifacts from using time-averaged calibration data, and the non-uniqueness of the empirically-inferred collision frequencies. These results are discussed in the context of their implications for discovering and validating new closures necessary for enabling fully-predictive Hall thruster models.}

    abstract = "{The behavior of four algebraic closure models for anomalous electron transport is investigated using a fluid Hall thruster code. The models, which were selected because they have been previously described in the literature, are calibrated against a baseline experimental condition of a 9-kW-class magnetically shielded Hall thruster operating at 300 V and 15 A on xenon propellant. The extensibility of the models is then assessed by using this calibrated model to simulate three additional operating conditions—300 V and 30 A, 600 V and 15 A, and 300 V and 15 A operating on krypton propellant. The quality of the model prediction is quantified by comparing the model outputs to experimental measurements of discharge current, thrust, and ion velocity. It is found that while none of the models can predict the ion acceleration characteristics accurately, some compare favorably in terms of the scaling of thrust and discharge current across operating conditions. The limitations of the models are attributed to the coupling between the functional scaling of the closure models with respect to the local plasma properties and the fluid model. The role of the electron energy balance in this coupling is also highlighted. These results are discussed in the context of motivating improved closure models of the anomalous electron transport in Hall thrusters.}",

    abstract = { The performance of a magnetically shielded Hall thruster operating on xenon and krypton is characterized at discharge current densities up to 10 times greater than its nominal level. A thrust stand and far-field probe suite are employed to evaluate operation at 300 V discharge voltage and discharge currents from 15 to 125 A (xenon) and from 15 to 150 A (krypton). The thrust, specific impulse, and anode efficiency at the highest currents are found to be 1650±30  mN, 2309±56  s, and 52.8±2.0\% respectively for xenon, and 1839±18  mN, 2567±48  s, and 55.0±1.6\% for krypton. The thrust density at the highest conditions are shown to be six (xenon) and eight (krypton) times higher than the lowest current condition. A maximum in anode efficiency as a function of discharge current is observed for both gases. This is attributed to a trade between mass utilization, which increases to unity with current, and beam utilization, which gradually decreases with current. The dependence of these efficiency modes on current is discussed in the context of a series of first-principles scaling laws. The observation that efficiency only moderately decreases with current density is examined in the context of high-power electric propulsion development. }

    abstract = {The increasing need to demonstrate the correctness of computer simulations has highlighted the importance of benchmarks. We define in this paper a representative simulation case to study low-temperature partially-magnetized plasmas. Seven independently developed particle-in-cell codes have simulated this benchmark case, with the same specified conditions. The characteristics of the codes used, such as implementation details or computing times and resources, are given. First, we compare at steady-state the time-averaged axial profiles of three main discharge parameters (axial electric field, ion density and electron temperature). We show that the results obtained exhibit a very good agreement within 5% between all the codes. As  discharges are known to cause instabilities propagating in the direction of electron drift, an analysis of these instabilities is then performed and a similar behaviour is retrieved between all the codes. A particular attention has been paid to the numerical convergence by varying the number of macroparticles per cell and we show that the chosen benchmark case displays a good convergence. Detailed outputs are given in the supplementary data, to be used by other similar codes in the perspective of code verification.}
