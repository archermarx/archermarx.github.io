    <p>I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan.
  	I work in the Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory (PEPL).
    My research involves computational modeling of electric propulsion devices, such as magnetic nozzles and Hall thrusters.
    You can find a list of my publications <a href="publications.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>I offer consulting services on a case-by-case basis. More info is available <a href="consulting.html">here</a>. </p>

    <p>Here's an accessible five-minute video I made which introduces my research in Hall thrusters</p>

    <p>
        Aside from electric propulsion research, I have many other interests, including
        map-making, illustration, science fiction worldbuilding, 3D printing, and guitar playing.
        I also enjoy some recreational programming.
        You can learn about some of my other projects <a href="projects.html">here,</a> and view
        a portfolio of my artistic work <a href="portfolio.html">here.</a>
